# Enhanced String Calculator Challenge
The objective of the test is to develop a string calculator by completing a series of incremental tasks. Enphasizing on understanding the learning process, critical thinking and problem solving abilities.

## Repository Estructure
There are two main folders `Python` and `F#` each contains the scripst of the tasks in their respective language. Inside of both folders there is a `Reflections.md` file that has the thought process of each task.

```bash
── technical test/
│   ├── F#/
│   │   ├── Task1.fsx
│   │   ├── Task1.fsx
│   │   ├── Reflections.md
│   │   ├── ...

│   ├── Python/
│   │   ├── Task1.py
│   │   ├── Task1.py
│   │   ├── Reflections.md
│   │   ├── ...
```

## Executing the scripts

### Python

```
python TaskX.py
```

### F#
For executing my scripts in F# I decided to use FSI for its simplicity.

```
dotnet fsi TaskX.fsx
```
